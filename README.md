# TypeScript Template

I did a TypeScript template to star any project with that lenguage.

## Dependecies:
This TypeScript template has the next dependencies:

1. TypeScript
2. Prettier
3. Eslint

For init this template you got to do:
```
npm install
```

For run the main.ts I should run:
```
npm run build
```

If I want to see the output, I can run:
```
node build/main
```
